# Trolley Tracker - Web - [Archived in June 2023]

<p>From 2014-2021, Code For Greenville members built and maintained the technology which allowed thousands of locals and visitors to track the downtown Greenville trolleys in real-time from their mobile devices.<p>

<p>As of June 30, 2023, <a href="https://codeforamerica.org/news/reflections-on-the-brigade-networks-next-chapter/">Code For America officially withdrew fiscal sponsorship and use of the "Code For" trademark to <strong>all</strong> national brigades</a>, including Code For Greenville.</p>

<p>After July 1st, 2023, contributors can get involved with two re-branded efforts:</p>

<ul>
	<li>For ongoing civic projects, connect with <a href="https://opencollective.com/code-for-the-carolinas">Code For The Carolina</a> (which itself will rebrand by the end of 2023)</li>
	<li>For local tech APIs and OpenData projects, see the <a href="https://github.com/hackgvl">HackGreenville Labs repositories on GitHub</a> and connect with the team in the <em>#hg-labs</em> channel on the <a href="https://hackgreenville.com/join-slack">HackGreenville Slack</a></li>
</ul>

Simple Django Webapp to display the information from the Code for Greenville Trolley Tracker API.  The webapp is designed to be brought into web pages as an iFrame, or viewed directly.  It also will bring in the current running schedules from the API if no routes are currently active.

@thedanfields created the original version of the API, and @bikeoid created the newer .NET API.
